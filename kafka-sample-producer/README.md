# kafka-sample-producer
This is a spring boot sample application that makes use of the kafka-connector and kafka-broker to bind to a kafka service and produce messages.

## Using kafka-sample-producer
1. Git checkout and build the modules (if you have not already done so):

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:cf-platform-eng/kafka-service-broker.git
  cd kafka-service-broker
  mvn clean install
  ```
  
2. Deploy kafka-sample-producer. There is nothing to configure, other than maybe changing the name of the services in the manifest file, because the name should match the name you give to the kafka-service created.
  ```bash
  cd kafka-sample-producer
  cf push
  ```
  
3. Once the app has been pushed successfully and is running, tail the app logs using the following command:
  ```bash
  cf logs kafka-sample-producer
  ```  
  
4. The producer app will send messages every 10 seconds and the logs will reflect that. Look at the [README](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kafka-service-broker/tree/master/kafka-sample-consumer) for kafka-sample-consumer to set up an app to subscribe to the messages published by kafka-sample-producer. It will work as long as they are both bound to the _same_ kafka service instance.
